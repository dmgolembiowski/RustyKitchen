"If we wanted to change the instance that we’ve called the method on as
part of what the method does, we’d use &mut self as the first parameter. Having a
method that takes ownership of the instance by using just self as the first parameter is
rare; this technique is usually used when the method transforms self into something
else and you want to prevent the caller from using the original instance after the
transformation." -The Book
