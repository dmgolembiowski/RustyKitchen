1. What is `shadowing`?
    Shadowing is effectively creating a new variable 
    when using a pattern with the `let` keyword, like:
        
        fn main() {
            let x = 5; 
            let x = x + 1; // For emphasis, not writing x += 1
            let x = x * 2;
        }

    but unlike a context using a mutable expression, like:

        fn main() {
            let mut spaces = "   ";
            spaces = spaces.len();
        }

    then the compiler raises a compile-time error hinting that
    we weren't allowed to mutate a variable's type, as evidenced 
    by the Err("mismatched types") that shows up.
