Box<T>
- Allows you to store data on the heap rather than the stack;
- Likely limited to use in only the following circumstances:
    1.) "When you have a type whose size can't be known at compile time and you want to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size"
        --> Could this resemble the data an incoming email body? 
        --> ................... a container of data receiving from an incoming client socket connection?
    2.) "When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but ensure the data won't be copied when you do so"
        --> The training phase of a Training Cycle in machine learning (depending on the topology)?
    3.) "When you want to own a value and you care only that it's a type that implements a particular (non-generic?) trait rather than being a specific type?
        --> (No idea)
