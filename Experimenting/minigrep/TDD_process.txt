add the searching logic to the minigrep program by using the Testdriven development (TDD) process. This software development technique follows these
steps:
1. Write a test that fails and run it to make sure it fails for the reason you expect.
2. Write or modify just enough code to make the new test pass.
3. Refactor the code you just added or changed and make sure the tests continue to
pass.
4. Repeat from step 1!
