Regular Reference (&<this: T>)
------------------------------


Smart Pointers
--------------
+ Box<T>:
    has a known size and points to data allocated on the heap
+ Rc<T>:
    keeps track of the number of references to data on the heap
    so that data can have multiple owners
+ RefCell<T>:
    (has interior mutability)
    -offers us a type that we can use when we need an 
    immutable type but need to change an inner value of that type;
    -enforces the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time
